# Timestamp Micro-Service

This project was created as part of the courses over at [Free Code Camp][1].

## Purpose

This [project][2], is meant to take a date, either in natural language,
`December 15, 2015`, or as a UNIX time stamp `1450137600` and return an JSON
object that contains both the UNIX time stamp and natural language data.

```json
{
  "Unix": 1450137600,
  "natural": "December 15, 2015"
}
```
